# The C = 2A Measurement Bridge

This module proves the central equivalence between recognition cost C
and the residual-model rate action A.

Main theorem: For any two-branch geodesic rotation,
  C = 2A  (exactly)

This establishes that quantum measurement and recognition are governed
by the same unique cost functional J.
